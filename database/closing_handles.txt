I won't bother with checking errors on closing handles. Most of the time there
shouldn't be any issues when closing a valid handle.
If a handle is closed it also won't be used after the close.
Closing multiple handles with error reporting in c is also quite error prone.

Handle h1 = open(), h2 = open(), h3(open);

int r1 = close(h1);
int r2 = close(h2);
int r3 = close(h3);

bool error = false;
if (r1 == ERROR)
{
	log_error("h1");
	error = true;
}

if (r2 == ERROR)
{
	log_error("h2");
	error = true;
}

if (r3 == ERROR)
{
	log_error("h3");
	error = true;
}

if (error == true)
{
	return ERROR;
}

Asserting is simpler.
