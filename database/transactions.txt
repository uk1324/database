Transactions could be implemented by creating a file before executing an instruction
which would store the data before the operation and the operation that is going to happen.
I would need to save the file to disk with every operation in the transation.
This would be quite slow but it should make it rollbacking state easy.

Another issue with transactions is ensuring that no one can read the data before
the transaction is finished would require quite a bit of locking.
